# Multiâ€‘Model Leader Correction for Algorithmic Trading in Forex Market

## ðŸ“‘ Project Overview
This repository contains the full implementation, datasets, and results of my MSc thesis:

> **"Multiâ€‘Model Leader Correction Consensus Approach for Developing Algorithmic Trading Systems in the Forex Market"**  
> Department of Data Science, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

The research develops a dynamic **Leader Correction (LC)** consensus framework that selects the bestâ€‘performing predictive trading model in each sliding window based on recent performance and adjusts trading signals to maximize profit and reduce risk. This approach combines statistical technical indicators with dataâ€‘driven optimization for enhanced trading robustness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Maximize Net Profit** in USD for selected currency pairs.
- **Increase Profitâ€‘toâ€‘Risk Ratio** by switching leaders dynamically.
- **Reduce Relative Drawdown** compared to singleâ€‘model and static consensus.
- Ensure **robust generalization** to unseen test datasets.

## ðŸ›  Metaheuristics Used
Four metaheuristic optimization algorithms were implemented and compared:
1. Genetic Algorithm (**GA**)
2. Particle Swarm Optimization (**PSO**)
3. Whale Optimization Algorithm (**WOA**)
4. Seagull Optimization Algorithm (**SBO**)

Each algorithm optimizes parameters:
- `n_SMA` â€“ Simple Moving Average window size
- `d11` â€“ PPPL threshold parameter
- `SL` â€“ Stop Loss
- `TP` â€“ Take Profit

# Multiâ€‘Model Leader Correction for Algorithmic Trading in Forex Market

## ðŸ“‘ Project Overview
This repository contains the full implementation, datasets, and results of my MSc thesis:

> **"Multiâ€‘Model Leader Correction Consensus Approach for Developing Algorithmic Trading Systems in the Forex Market"**  
> Department of Data Science, Faculty of Mathematical Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

The research develops a dynamic **Leader Correction (LC)** consensus framework that selects the bestâ€‘performing predictive trading model in each sliding window based on recent performance and adjusts trading signals to maximize profit and reduce risk. This approach combines statistical technical indicators with dataâ€‘driven optimization for enhanced trading robustness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Maximize Net Profit** in USD for selected currency pairs.
- **Increase Profitâ€‘toâ€‘Risk Ratio** by switching leaders dynamically.
- **Reduce Relative Drawdown** compared to singleâ€‘model and static consensus.
- Ensure **robust generalization** to unseen test datasets.

## ðŸ›  Metaheuristics Used
Four metaheuristic optimization algorithms were implemented and compared:
1. Genetic Algorithm (**GA**)
2. Particle Swarm Optimization (**PSO**)
3. Whale Optimization Algorithm (**WOA**)
4. Seagull Optimization Algorithm (**SBO**)

Each algorithm optimizes parameters:
- `n_SMA` â€“ Simple Moving Average window size
- `d11` â€“ PPPL threshold parameter
- `SL` â€“ Stop Loss

- `TP` â€“ Take Profit
- ðŸ“Š Outputs & Results
All generated results can be found in the `/output/` folder.  
They include Excel files summarizing:

- **Optimal_Parameters.xlsx** â€“ Optimal values for `n_SMA`, `d11`, `SL`, `TP` obtained via GA, WOA, PSO, SBO.
- **Performance_Comparison.xlsx** â€“ Net Profit, Profit/Risk ratio, and Max Drawdown before and after optimization.
- **Leader_Correction_Summary.xlsx** â€“ Performance of dynamic leader switching across sliding windows.

> GitHub cannot preview `.xlsx` files online. Download them locally to view in Excel or LibreOffice.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/n1e9g9a9rna/ForexLeaderCorrection_GA_WOA_PSO_SBO.git
Navigate into the project folder:
cd ForexLeaderCorrection_GA_WOA_PSO_SBO
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the desired optimization algorithm (example: GA Leader Correction):
python src/ga_leader_correction.py
The results will be generated in the /output/ folder as .xlsx
